# Downloader

This is just a quick project I threw together to dowload some files quickly from a webserver. There is a ton missing
from this but it got the job done. I didn't want to visit this site with a regular browser, and my bash skills aren't
sharp enough to iterate through all this stuff and download it quickly.



## Background
I needed this stuff in a hurry because my domain got hijacked in the Google Search Console (GSC). Specifically, I had
deleted a virtual server some time ago but failed to delete it's A record at my DNS provider. Somebody got a virtual
host from my same hosting company today and was assigned my former public IP address. Since they now had a DNS record
on my domain pointing to a new server that they controlled, they registered as owner of the domain with GSC and
they were able to pass Google's verifiction of domain ownership. Once they were verified they uploaded a sitemap file
to GSC. Because I had previously claimed ownership of the entire domain (the Bad Actor (BA) only proved ownership of a
single host) I was notified via email that there was a new verified user for the host. I was able to quickly revoke
the BA's rights to the host at GSC. [Google forum post on the hijack](https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/2185736?hl=en)
